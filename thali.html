          <h1>17+ THALI AND INDIAN LUNCH MENU RECIPES</h1>
          <p style="width: 800px; font-family: 'Kelvinch',sans-serif ;">The Indian thali is a wholesome combination of
            colorful
            dishes served next to each other on a single plate. It is the perfect depiction of Indian cuisine. My thali meal
            ideas are utterly simple, nourishing, and full of flavors.‘Thali’ is a Hindi word for – a big, round plate
            on which food is served. Small eating bowls known as ‘katori’ are placed within the thali, each
            containing a dish. This whole platter is served as a set meal for lunch or dinner. The portion size of
            thali is sufficient for an individual.
    
            A thali meal is an age-old Indian tradition that is hard to find nowadays in modern families due to busy
            schedules. Still, there are many restaurants and food joints that serve these set meal
            platters with traditional Indian dishes.
